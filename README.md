# TeacherHire
An older female applicant for a job reckons her failure to be hired as a teacher is due to her age. So she accuses the school of illegally favoring younger (i.e. under 40 years old ) applicants. The school, on the other side, contradicts by saying that the differences of admission among agegroups can be explained by other characteristics of applicants. Using dataset collected from school files, I concluded that for applicants living in the same town and living out of state, no significant bias toward older applicants are found. For applicants living in the state but not in this town, strong favor towards younger group exists.
